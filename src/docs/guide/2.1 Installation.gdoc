h3. Install plugin

Basically it's just adding dependency into `BuildConfig.groovy`:

{code}
    plugins {
        compile "org.grails.plugins:spring-security-facebook:0.15.1"
    }
{code}

and calling (optionaly) configuration wizards by:
{code}
grails s2-quickstart //configure Spring Security Core
grails s2-init-facebook //configure Spring Security Facebook
{code}

Or you can edit `Config.groovy` instead, see [Configuration|guide:4 Configuration] section.

Follow [Basic Usage|guide:3.1 Basic Usage] guide for next steps.
